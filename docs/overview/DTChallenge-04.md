# Build a Custom Dynatrace App (Bonus)

[< Previous Bonus Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../index.md)** 

## Introduction

We have learned how to use Copilot for several different things, eg: Improve instrumentation or improve Dynatrace setup.

As a bonus hackathon task we want you to create your own Dynatrace App that displays the most important information about the Casino App. Its up to your imagination on what that app looks like. Could be to visualize key metrics or errors or its just a portal to open your app in the browser.

The goal of this excericse is to also make you familiar with building your own Dynatrace App

## Description

In this challenge you will learn how use the Dynatrace App Kit to create a new app and using CoPilot to add new features

### Step 1: Create a new App

Follow the instructions on https://developer.dynatrace.com to create a new Dynatrace app

### Step 2: Install the Dynatrace App Extension in VS Code

Install the extension and authenticate against our Hackathon Tenant. This extension not only provides productivity tools to build, deploy or create new functions. It also comes with its own Dynatrace MCP Server that provides information about the Strato Design System to your Copilot

### Step 3: Deploy the app on the Development Server

Test if the sample app runs

### Step 4: Add some features

Use CoPilot to create new features in the Dynatrace App. There is an agents.md file that comes with every new Dynatrace App that includes instructions!
