# Improve your OpenTelemetry instrumentation

[< Previous Challenge](./DTChallenge-01.md) - **[Home](../index.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./DTChallenge-03.md)

## Introduction

Now that we know how to query our logs, metrics, spans and workload details its time to improve our instrumentation. Because, a default instrumentation often doesnt provide enough details when having to troubleshoot a production issue or when needing to report on business insights where the data is not yet available in logs, metrics or spans.

## Description

In this challenge you will learn how use CoPilot to improve your OpenTelemetry instrumentation without having to be an expert in coding

- **Analyze your current instrumentation**: Either look at your spans in Dynatrace to identify where you miss details on long running transactions or miss details on those where an error happens. Or - just use CoPilot to get recommendations!

- **Improve your instrumentation**: Make code changes to improve instrumentation. Redeploy the app. Play some games and validate if you see more details!

## Success Criteria
You will have successfully completed this challenge when you:

- Demonstrated how to identify instrumentation gaps
- Improved OpenTelemetry instrumentation
